# Python sample code of 2D NDT Scan Matching
This Python script demonstrates a 2D scan matching algorithm called Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) for aligning two point clouds.

## Usage

```bash
python script/normal_distributions_transform.py
```
.
## Results
The source points (red), target points (blue), and transformed source points (green).

```
True transform: [0.1        0.2        0.26179939]
Estimated transform: [0.11679415 0.28055845 0.25984399]
```
